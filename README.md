#### General Info:

* A **Magnetic Stirrer** or magnetic mixer is a laboratory device that employs a rotating magnetic field to cause a stir bar (or flea) immersed in a liquid to spin very quickly, thus stirring it. More details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stirrer
* **Yeasts** are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols in a process known as fermentation. More details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast
* **Homebrewing** is the brewing of beer, on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes. Brewing domestically also affords one the freedom to adjust recipes according to one's own preference, create beverages that are unavailable on the open market or beverages that may contain fewer calories, or less or more alcohol.
